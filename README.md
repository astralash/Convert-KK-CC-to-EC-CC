# FromKKtoEC

	Automatically convert KK chara cards in current folder and its subfolders to EC cards.
	
	Output will be placed in a new folder with original folder structure.
	The new folder is named "ConvertedFromKKtoEC" + TimeStamp.
	
	It's safe to use because the result will not cover original files.
	
	It will not convert pngs that is not a CC or already EC.
	
	The KKEx part is through simply copying, so it's not sure all information is transplanted correctly.
	
	It will generate 7 cards for each set of clothes, you can change it in the script

# FromKKtoEC_only1

	Only the frist set of clothes will be outputed.
	
# FromKKtoEC_only3

	Only the first 3 sets of clothes will be outputed.	
	
	Theoretically, the number can be get from input easily. But just to keep it simple(I'm lazy to design a UI even just a CLI), it's seperated to 3 program. 
	For advanced configuration, you can just edit the script.
